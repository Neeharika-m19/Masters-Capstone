# ðŸŽ“ Student Housing Dashboard & Data Visualization

A comprehensive **Tableau**â€‘powered dashboard showcasing key insights from a student housing survey at Arizona State University. Built as part of IFTâ€¯598: Data Visualization & Reporting to IT, this project guides prospective tenants, administrators, parents and investors through interactive charts on rent, amenities, commute, lease periods and more.

## ðŸ“– Overview

Students and stakeholders need clear, dataâ€‘driven insights when choosing onâ€‘ or offâ€‘campus housing. We collected **194** survey responses covering:

- Apartment types & rents  
- Campus affiliation  
- Amenities & challenges  
- Mode of transportation  
- Lease periods & living expenses  

Using modern visualization techniques (pie, bar, line, maps, highlight tables), we deliver an atâ€‘aâ€‘glance decision support tool.
